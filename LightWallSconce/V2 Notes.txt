Notes for the next build, if I make one:

1) The wire hold should be drilled in the side of the 3D printed sconce, so as to almost 
   completely hide the wires instead of them being easily visible under each sconce.
   
2) I should at least attempt to wire the lights in sequence, though I may need wire thinner
   than 26 Guage for that, since it'll mean 4 wires per sconce (except the last one)
   
3) A 3D printed heart-shaped container that fits onto the inner-most heart on the tealight
   frame could contain all of the circuit and hide all wires, which would make the project
   far more presentable.
   
4) The "PAUSE" button, in retrospect, is unnecessary. Even the secondary button that changes
   sub-modes is undesired. Just the one button is fine. Consider changing to a switch, as well.
